# C -=- 1

A language designed to fully support compile-time meta programming without creating a "shadow language". The programmer has access to the semantic model of their program and almost all code is compile-time executable (see the documentation for detailed explanation).

The documentation is available [here](Docs/Documentation.md).

C-=-1 standard library implementation is in progress and can be found [here](Libraries/std)
